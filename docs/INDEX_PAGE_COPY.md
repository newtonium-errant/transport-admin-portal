## Our Story (Founder Section)

**Section Intro:**
Rural Route Transportation Services was founded by a veteran who experienced firsthand the challenges of getting to medical appointments in rural Nova Scotia.

**Body Text:**
After years of navigating long distances and limited transportation options, the idea for RRTS was born out of a simple belief: no one should miss a medical appointment because they can't get there. What started as a mission to help fellow veterans has grown into a service that supports the entire community across the Annapolis Valley.

**Founder Quote:**
"I know what it's like to need a ride and not have one. That's why I started RRTS — so no one in our community has to face that alone."

**Quote Attribution:**
— Founder, RRTS
